1. Introduction:
The Breakline Extractor is a powerful tool designed to convert elevation data into detailed surface breaklines. 
You can choose between point-based or edge-based breaklines, depending on your needs.

2. Getting Started:
Before you begin, ensure you have your elevation data ready in a compatible format (ASCII file).

3. Importing Data:
Use the 'Import Raw Data' button to select your elevation data file. 
The tool requires X, Y, and Z coordinates for each point.

4. Data Processing Parameters:
Adjust the following parameters to customize your analysis:

	Decimal Places to Round: Set the number of decimal places to consider in the data.
	Block Size: Choose the block size for analysis.
	Span Across Highest/Lowest Point: Set the span across the highest and lowest points for analysis.
	Min. Local Height Difference: Define the minimum local height difference to consider.
	Section Median Coverage (%): Specify the percentage for section median coverage. (A section consists of 'Block Size' number of blocks)

5. Additional Export Options:
Choose whether to export:

	Export Points: A separate file containing only the points.
	Export Edges: A separate file containing only the edges.

6. Breakline Length and Neighbors:
Customize the breakline length and neighbors:

	Min. Breakline Length Along X,Y Coordinates: Set the minimum breakline length along X and Y coordinates.
	Max. Length Between Points for Connectivity: Define the maximum length between two neighboring points.
	Max. Length for Closed Edges: Set the maximum length to close open edges.

7. Row Selection:
Specify the series of rows to be skipped

8. Column Selection:
Specify the column numbers for your data:

	X Column: Column number for X-coordinate data.
	Y Column: Column number for Y-coordinate data.
	Z Column: Column number for Z-coordinate data.

9. CPU Configuration:
Utilize the CPU configuration options:

	Available Logical CPUs: Displays the number of logical CPUs available.
	CPUs to Use: Choose the number of CPUs to use for processing.

10. Submitting for Analysis:
Once you've configured the parameters, click the 'Submit' button to initiate the analysis process.

11. Output Options:
The tool generates surface breaklines based on your settings. 
You can obtain point-based or edge-based breaklines depending on your export options.

12. Viewing Results: 
To visualize and interact with the generated output, consider utilizing third-party tools such as 'CloudCompare', 'MeshLab', or similar applications. 
These tools enhance your viewing experience and allow you to explore the results in greater detail.

13. Conclusion:
The Breakline Extractor empowers you to transform elevation data into informative surface breaklines. 
Experiment with the various parameters to uncover valuable insights.

You can use the 'Sample Data' from 'File' menu to test and experience the functionality of the tool. 
Alternatively, you have the flexibility to employ your own dataset, provided it adheres to the format with records consisting of latitude (lat), 
longitude (lon), and elevation points. This customization allows users to work with their specific geographic data for accurate surface profiling.
